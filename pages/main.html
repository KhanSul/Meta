        Leather tanning is the process of treating animal hides to produce durable and flexible leather. The primary purpose of tanning is to stabilize the collagen fibers in the hide, making it resistant to decomposition and suitable for various uses. There are several tanning methods, each imparting distinct characteristics to the leather.<br />
        <br />
        Vegetable tanning is one of the oldest and most traditional methods, using natural tannins derived from plant sources like tree bark, leaves, and fruits. This process can take several weeks, allowing the tannins to penetrate deeply into the hide. The result is a firmer, more rigid leather that ages beautifully, developing a rich patina over time. Wallets crafted from vegetable-tanned leather are prized for their durability and unique aesthetic, which becomes more pronounced with use.
